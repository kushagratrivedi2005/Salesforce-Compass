vehicle dataset- first tried SIAM (scociet of Indian automobile manufacturers)
INR 48,500+ GST (Indian Subscribers) & USD 1,500 (Foreign Subscribers) - Per Annum (Apr-March) 
paid so left 

then tried federation of automotive dealers(FADA)but website closed 
then tried Trading economic but it is paid
then tried https://datasource.kapsarc.org/explore/dataset/india-vehicle-sales-trends but data available only till 2022
then tried data.gov.in but last updated in 2019
then tried https://dataful.in/datasets/18262/ but is paid
then tried https://ckandev.indiadataportal.com/ but data is available only of JAN month so can't do monthwise analysis
finally used govenment data from https://analytics.parivahan.gov.in/analytics/vahanpublicreport?lang=en 
three datasets from 2023 to 2025 sorted by fuel,vehicle_category, vehicle_class



for the fuel price the dataset is from government international prices of crude oil,Indian basket
https://ppac.gov.in/prices/international-prices-of-crude-oil

for the holidays it was difficult to classify a holiday and Government recognized only few holidays as natinoal with no dataset or API
so used holidays python library to generate the dataset

for the interest rates the dataset used was Interest Rates: Long-Term Government Bond Yields: 10-Year: Main (Including Benchmark) for India (INDIRLTLT01STM)
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDIRLTLT01STM

for the policies and repo rate data with these fields fame_ii,fame_iii,pm_edrive,bs7_norms,bharat_ncap,scrappage_policy,pli_scheme,repo_rate_cut_2025,repo_rate
the flags were generated using an automated python script

ran this sciprt to combine sales data from fuel,vehicle_category and vehicle_class fieldshellgamerhell@Kushagras-Air dataset % python3 join_datasets.py
